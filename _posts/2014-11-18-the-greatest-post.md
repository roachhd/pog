This book is filled with inspiring snippets of bad writing and good writing. You'll recognize your mistakes in the bad examples, and won't make them again. You'll be inspired to go write more, just to test out your newly inspired skills. Alongside the examples, Richard has wonderful explanations, to really help hook these guidelines into your memory.
